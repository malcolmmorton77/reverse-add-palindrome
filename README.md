# reverse-add-palindrome

## Concept:

- given a number, provide the resulting palindrome if there exists one
- reverse a given number and add it to itself
- this generates a new number which you can again reverse
- continue until a palindrome is produced or the number becomes too large

## Usage:

- clone the repository
- compile the program using `g++ pali.cpp -o <name>`
- run the program by typing `./<name>`
